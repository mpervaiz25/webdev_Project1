    <h2>The Alphawood Arboretum</h2>
    <p>
      Did you know our very own campus here at Illinois Tech is considered a Level 1 accredited Arboretum. We have over 1,800 trees spanning about 70 different species. The addition of all these trees was thanks to landscape architect Alfred Caldwell. 
	  He worked in collaboration with the architect Mies who is the main architect of all the buildings on our campus, Caldwell's landscape design of irregular trees is truly what makes our campus unique. 
      Some of the trees he planted included honey locust, gingko, and robinia, we will explore these next.
